//The code of this tutorial has been tested against Eliom 4.// \\

<<|wip|This tutorial is work in progress. Please send us any mistake or comment./>>

In this tutorial, we will show how to use the Ocsigen framework
(mainly Eliom) to write a lightweight Web site by generating pages
using OCaml functions. The goal is to show that using Eliom is
possible even if you don't need all the features (for example if you
don't want HTML typing or client side features). Besides, this will
make possible to extend your Web site in a full Web application
if you want, later. This tutorial is also a good overview of the basics
of Eliom.


==@@id="service"@@ A service generating a page==

The following code shows how to create a service that will answer
for requests at URL {{{http://.../aaa/bbb}}}, by calling the following
Ocaml function {{{f}}}:

<<code language="ocaml" |

 f : (string * string) list -> unit -> string Lwt.t

>>

{{{f}}} generates HTML as a string, taking as argument
the list of URL parameters (GET parameters).

<<code language="ocaml" |

let f _ () =
  Lwt.return "<html><head><title>A</title></head><body>B</body></html>"

let main_service =
  Eliom_registration.Html_text.register_service
    ~path:["aaa"; "bbb"]
    ~get_params:Eliom_parameter.any
    f

>>

{{{Eliom_paramer.any}}} means that the service takes any GET parameter.

We recommend to use the program {{{eliom-distillery}}}
to generate a template for your application (a Makefile and a default
configuration file for Ocsigen Server).


<<code language="shell"|
$ eliom-distillery -name mysite -template basic -target-directory mysite
>>

Put these lines in file {{{mysite.eliom}}}, compile and run the server by
doing:

<<code language="shell"|
$ make test.byte
>>

Your page is now available at URL [[http://localhost:8080/aaa/bbb|{{{http://localhost:8080/aaa/bbb}}}]].

If you dont want to use the Makefile provided by eliom-distillery,
just replace {{{mysite.eliom}}} by a file {{{mysite.ml}}},
compile and run with

<<code language="shell"|
$ ocamlfind ocamlc -package eliom.server -thread -c mysite.ml
$ ocsigenserver -c mysite.conf
>>

where mysite.conf is adapted from
 {{{local/etc/mysite/mysite-test.conf}}}
by replacing mysite.cma by your cmo.

==@@id="post"@@ POST service==

Services using the POST HTTP method are created using the function
<<a_api project="eliom" | val Eliom_service.Http.post_service >>.
To create a service with POST parameters, first you must create
a service without POST parameters and then the service with POST
parameters, with the first service as fallback. The fallback will be used
if the user comes back later without POST parameters, for example
because he put a bookmark on this URL.

<<code language="ocaml"|

let g getp postp = Lwt.return "..."

let post_service =
  Eliom_registration.Html_text.register_post_service
    ~fallback:main_service
    ~post_params:Eliom_parameter.any
    g
>>

==@@id="misc"@@ Going further==

That is probably all you need for a very basic Web site in OCaml.

Instead of generating HTML in OCaml strings, we highly recommend to use
//typed HTML//. It is very easy to use (once you have learned the basics)
and helps a lot to efficiently write modular and valid HTML.
To do this, use module
<<a_api project="eliom" subproject="server"| module Eliom_registration.Html5>>
instead of
<<a_api project="eliom" subproject="server"| module Eliom_registration.Html_text>>.
See this
<<a_manual project="tuto" chapter="application" fragment="tyxml"|tutorial>>
for more information, and a comprehensive documentation
<<a_manual project="tyxml"|here>>
and a more advanced manual
<<a_manual project="eliom" chapter="clientserver-html"|here>>.

Have a look at Eliom's API documentation to see other kinds of services,
for example <<a_api project="eliom" subproject="server"| module Eliom_registration.Redirection>>
to create HTTP redirections.

Eliom also has a way to typecheck forms and GET or POST parameters.
By giving a description of the parameters your service expects,
Eliom will check their presence automatically, and convert them
for you to OCaml types.
See
<<a_manual project="tuto" chapter="interaction" |this tutorial>>
and <<a_manual project="eliom" chapter="server-params"|this manual page>>.

Eliom also has other ways to identify services (rather than just the PATH
in the URL). For example Eliom can identify a service just by a parameter
(whatever the path is). This is called //non-attached coservices// and
this makes possible for example to have the same feature on every page
(for example a connection service).
See
<<a_manual project="tuto" chapter="interaction" |this tutorial>>
and <<a_manual project="eliom" chapter="server-services"|this manual page>>.

One of the main features of Eliom is the ability to write complete
Web and mobile applications in OCaml. Annotations are used to
separate the code to be executed on server side from the client code.
Client functions are translated into Javascript using
[[wiki(30):|Ocsigen Js_of_ocaml]].
See
<<a_manual project="tuto" chapter="tutowidgets" |this tutorial>> for
a quick introduction,
or <<a_manual project="tuto" chapter="application" |this one>> for a
more comprehensive one.
You can also have a look at
<<a_manual project="eliom" chapter="clientserver-applications"|this manual page>>.

Another interesting feature of Eliom is its session model, that uses a
very simple interface to record session data on server side.
It is even possible to choose
the //scope// of this data: either a browser, or a tab, or even a group
of browsers (belonging for example to a same user).
See
<<a_manual project="tuto" chapter="interaction" fragment="eref" |this section>>
and the beginning of
<<a_manual project="eliom" chapter="server-state"|this manual page>>.
