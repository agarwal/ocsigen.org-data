= Implicit server parameters

<<wip|
The documentation is now mostly complete, but we are still working on it
(some parts need to be reworked, some small parts are missing).
We will release it as a PDF book in a few week.
Any help appreciated.>>

Starting from version 1.90, the server parameters are no more
explicitely passed as parameters. They are stored in Lwt's new local
thread storage mechanism.

Server parameters are only available in two place:
* during initialisation of a site ;
* during a request processing.

If your program failed with {{{"Server parameters not available
here"}}}, here a list of common mistakes.
