whether element is sticky~, either due to ~C~S~S attribute position~:sticky or 
    due to position~:sticky polyfill <<span class="odocwiki_inlinecode"|make~_sticky>>

determines how certain values of <<span class="odocwiki_inlinecode"|make~_sticky>> are computed
    <<span class="odocwiki_inlinecode"|`~Fix>> sets the value to a inline length when the element get stuck~.
    ~With <<span class="odocwiki_inlinecode"|`~Leave>> the value is not touched at all~.
    <<span class="odocwiki_inlinecode"|`~Sync>> causes the value to continuously ~(on window scroll~/resize~) be

position~:sticky polyfill which is not supported by ~Chrome~. ~It functions by
    making a clone with position~:fixed of the designated element and
    continuously ~(window scroll~/resize~) monitoring the position of the element
    and the clone~. ~The contents of the element is shifted back and forth between
    the two elements~. ~Make sure to also apply the ~C~S~S code "position~: sticky" to
    the element as this function has no effect if "position~: sticky" is
    supported by the browser~. ~The supplied element should be a ~D~-element~.

stop element from being sticky

make sure an element gets never out of sight while scrolling by continuously
    ~(window scroll~/resize~) monitoring the position of the element and adjusting
    the top~/left value~. ~Calls <<span class="odocwiki_inlinecode"|make~_sticky>>~. ~Make sure to also apply the ~C~S~S
    code "position~: sticky" to the element~.

stop element from being in sight ~(also stops the sticky polyfill~)
