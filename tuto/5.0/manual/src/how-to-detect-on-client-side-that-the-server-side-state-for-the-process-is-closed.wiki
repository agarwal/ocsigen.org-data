= How to detect on client side that the server side state for the process is closed? =

If you are using Eliom-base-app, you probably have nothing to do.
Eliom-base-app will monitor the life of sessions and close the process
when needed.

If you are not using Eliom-base-app, you must catch exceptions
{{{Eliom_comet.Channel_full}}},
{{{Eliom_comet.Channel_closed}}} (and {{{Eliom_comet.Process_closed}}}
on Eliom < 5).
For example, you can use a channel with a different client-process scope
to warn client processes that the session is closed.
Have a look at module {{{Eba_comet}}} in Eliom-base-app.
